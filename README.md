A movie-based social network, developed as a Software Engineering project. It makes use of the Facebook Graph API and Google Firebase Auth for user authentication. Movies are fetched from the TMDB API, and user data is stored in Google Firebase Firestore. The application also keeps track of user statistics with the Google Firebase Real-Time Database, which are shown in a Java Swing desktop client.
